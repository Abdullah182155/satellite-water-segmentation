### üî• **Highlight Metrics**

- **High Intersection over Union (IoU): 84%**
- **High F1 Score: 91%**

These metrics demonstrate the strong performance of the best models in accurately segmenting water bodies from multispectral satellite images.

## 1. Models and Encoders Overview

This project explores multiple semantic segmentation architectures using the [`segmentation_models_pytorch (smp)`](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch) library. The goal is to compare model performance on multispectral satellite images with selected bands as input.

### Models Used

- **UNet-baseline**  
  A classic U-Net model used as a baseline for multispectral segmentation with standard encoder-decoder architecture and BCE loss.

- **DeepLabV3**  
  Leverages Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) for capturing multi-scale context. Ideal for segmenting large-scale objects in remote sensing images.

- **UNet++ (Nested UNet)**  
  Features dense skip connections and deep supervision. Excels at fine-grained segmentation and boundary refinement.

- **PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network)**  
  Utilizes pyramid pooling for global and local context, effective for objects at various scales.

- **FPN (Feature Pyramid Network)**  
  Builds a top-down feature pyramid with lateral connections, great for multi-scale segmentation, especially in lightweight scenarios.

### Encoders (Backbones)

- **ResNet34** ‚Äî Balanced depth and performance.  
- **ResNet50** ‚Äî Deeper network with richer features.  
- **MobileNetV2** ‚Äî Lightweight and fast, suitable for resource-constrained environments.

### Common Settings

- **Input channels**: 8 selected multispectral bands `[5, 6, 12, 7, 9, 10, 11, 8]`  
- **Image size**: Resized to `256x256`  
- **Loss function**: `BCEWithLogitsLoss`  
- **Optimizer**: Adam (`lr=1e-4`)  
- **Augmentations**: Horizontal/vertical flips, rotations, brightness/contrast (using Albumentations)  
- **Logging**: Training runs tracked with MLflow  

### Outputs

- Training and validation loss curves  
- Dice and IoU metrics progression  
- Saved best model weights (`best_model.pth`)

### Visualization

- Sample predictions compared to ground truth masks  
- Visualization of individual spectral bands supported

## 4. Dataset Class: `WaterSegmentationDataset`

This custom PyTorch Dataset handles loading multispectral satellite images and their corresponding binary water masks.

- **Inputs**:  
  - `image_paths`: List of file paths to multispectral GeoTIFF images.  
  - `mask_paths`: List of file paths to grayscale binary mask images.  
  - `transform`: Optional Albumentations transformations applied jointly to image and mask.  
  - `selected_bands`: Optional list of 1-based band indices to select specific spectral bands from the images. If not provided, all bands are loaded.

- **Functionality**:  
  - Loads multispectral images with rasterio, selecting only the requested bands.  
  - Loads corresponding binary masks using OpenCV, converting them to binary format.  
  - Performs per-band min-max normalization on the images to scale values between 0 and 1.  
  - Applies any specified augmentations consistently to both images and masks.  
  - Returns tensors in `(channels, height, width)` format, suitable for model input.

This class ensures that the multispectral inputs and masks are properly aligned, normalized, and augmented during training.

## 2. Water Segmentation Using U-Net Transformer

This project aims at detecting water bodies in satellite imagery using a U-Net architecture with a Transformer-based MiT-B2 encoder.

### Dataset Structure

```
Water Segmentation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/      # 12-band multispectral GeoTIFF images
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/      # Corresponding binary water masks (.png)
```

- Each image should have a matching label with the same base filename.  
- Images are 12-channel GeoTIFF files.  
- Labels are single-channel grayscale binary masks.

### Model Architecture

- Backbone: MiT-B2 Transformer encoder  
- Input channels: 12 spectral bands  
- Output: Binary segmentation mask (water vs. non-water)

### Training Pipeline

- Resize images to 128x128  
- Apply Albumentations augmentations (flip, rotate)  
- Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]  
- Dataset split: 70% train / 15% validation / 15% test  
- Loss: Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)  
- Metrics: Dice Score and Intersection over Union (IoU)  
- Batch size: 4  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Training epochs: 20  
- Model checkpointing on best validation loss

### Outputs

- Training and validation loss curves  
- Dice and IoU metrics progression  
- Saved best model weights (`best_model.pth`)

### Visualization

- Sample predictions compared to ground truth masks  
- Visualization of individual spectral bands supported
